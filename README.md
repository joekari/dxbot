# dxbot
This is an irc bot I wrote for fun.

It's not optimized super well and some of the code could use refactoring, but it works and has been in consistent use and seeing updates for over a year.

Below are a list of commands:

*$say <text> -  will make the bot print your text
*$do <text> - will make the bot perform a /me of your text
*$mtg <card> - will link you to a MTG card
*$stuff - will print out a random string
*$dump - will message you all stored quotes
*$quote - will print a random stored quote
*$quote # - will print how many quotes are stored
*$quote <#> - will print the numbered quote
*$quote <nickname> - will print a random stored quote from that user
*$quote <nickname> <string> - will store a new quote
*$grab - will store the last non-command message as a quote
